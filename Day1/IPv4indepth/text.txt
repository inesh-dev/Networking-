ip address is a 32 address use to uniquely identify the device connected over the network
192.168.1.1
min:0.0.0.0
max:255.255.255.255

Genenrally ip address is mentioned in this way in most of the local computer
192.168.1.1/24
this /24 is the subnet mask which tells that the first 24 bits are network bit 
and the other bits are the host bit 

so for /24 as the subnet mask this notatoin is called CIDR notation
 the number of devices that can be connected to the network is 
    no of device =256-2=244
    the address for example 
    192.168.0.0 and 192.168.0.255
    these two ip address are reserverd
