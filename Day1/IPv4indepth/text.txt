ip address is a 32 address use to uniquely identify the device connected over the network
192.168.1.1
min:0.0.0.0
max:255.255.255.255

Genenrally ip address is mentioned in this way in most of the local computer
192.168.1.1/24
this /24 is the subnet mask which tells that the first 24 bits are network bit 
and the other bits are the host bit 

so for /24 as the subnet mask this notatoin is called CIDR notation
 the number of devices that can be connected to the network is 
    no of device =256-2=244
    the address for example 
    192.168.0.0 and 192.168.0.255
    these two ip address are reserved
 

 but ipv4 address may not be suffieint for the future use
 they have set the 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 as a reserved loop back address
 for eg localhost 125.0.0.1
