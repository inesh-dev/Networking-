Understanding Domain Name System (DNS)

    The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

        Root Level (RLD)
            Represented by a dot (.)
            It is the highest level in the DNS hierarchy
            Managed by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
    Contains all Top-Level Domains (TLDs).m098i7u

        Top-Level Domain (TLD)
            Examples: .com, .org, .net, .gov, .in
            TLDs are owned by organizations that have the authority to manage them
            These organizations are allowed to create Second-Level Domains

        Second-Level Domain
            Example: google in google.com
            Created under a TLD
            Ownership of second-level domains is granted by TLD registrars

        Subdomain
            Example: www in www.google.com
            Created under a second-level domain
            Can be multiple levels deep (e.g., mail.support.google.com)

    Important Rules
        The total length of a domain name (including dots) cannot exceed 255 characters.
        Each label (a part of the domain between dots) can be up to 63 characters long.

    Domain Registration
        While TLDs are owned by authorized organizations, they typically do not sell domains directly.
        Instead, domain registrars (also known as brokers), such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc., handle the sale and management of second-level domains to the public..
