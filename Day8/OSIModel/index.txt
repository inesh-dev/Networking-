Application layer
“In the Application Layer, the user’s applications use protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP, and DNS to communicate over the network. The interaction with data happens here, but the browser or email client itself is not the application layer—they simply use the services provided by this layer.”

Presntation layer
The Presentation Layer is like a translator and protector: it formats and encrypts data going down, and decrypts and translates data coming up. Its “client” above is always the Application Layer, and its “client” below is always the Session Layer.

Sessoin Layer 
The Session Layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating a session between two devices. A session is a logical connection that remains active while data is being transferred and is closed immediately once the transfer is complete, which is why this layer is called the Session Layer. It also provides checkpoints during data transfer to ensure reliability. For example, if 100 MB of data is being sent and a network issue occurs after 50 MB, the session can resume from the last checkpoint instead of starting over from the beginning. This layer ensures synchronization between devices and helps maintain a reliable and organized data transfer.

Transport Layer
It is the one that provides end-to-end communication, divides data into segments, ensures they are delivered correctly, and sends them to the network layer.it assign ports to the segment eg TCP ,UDP

Network Layer(if the device are on two different networks)
The Network Layer at the sending end takes the segments from the transport layer, encapsulates them into packets, and routes these packets across the network toward the destination device. It handles addressing (like IP addresses) and determines the best path for delivery, but it does not guarantee reliable delivery—that’s the transport layer’s job.source and destination address are added and they are called packets.Packet contain source ip dest ip and the port 

Datalink layer
here MAC address is added and it is called frames.It is responsible for error check

The Physical Layer
The Physical Layer is the actual physical link between two devices. It is responsible for transferring raw bits (0s and 1s) over the network medium, such as cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals.
