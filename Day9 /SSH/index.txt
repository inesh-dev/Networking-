SSH is a network protocol that allows you to securely connect to another device over a network and access its terminal (command line) remotely. It is widely used by system administrators, developers, and anyone who needs to manage remote servers safely.

Key Features of SSH

Secure Connection:
SSH encrypts all the data sent between your device and the remote device, preventing eavesdropping and ensuring privacy.

Remote Terminal Access:
You can open a terminal session on the remote machine and run commands as if you were physically using it.

Authentication:
SSH uses a username and password, or optionally key-based authentication, to ensure only authorized users can connect.

Port Forwarding and Tunneling:
SSH can also forward network traffic securely, allowing secure access to services on the remote machine.c
