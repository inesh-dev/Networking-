So yes, when you host a server on 0.0.0.0, it will listen on every IP address that your computer currently has, including:

The private IP of your LAN (192.168.x.x)

The local loopback (127.0.0.1)

Any other interfaces (like VPNs or Ethernet adapters)

✅ In short: 0.0.0.0 is like saying: “I don’t care which IP, just accept connections from all of them.”

If you want, I can make a quick visual diagram showing a device with multiple IPs and how 0.0.0.0 covers all of them. It makes it much easier to understand
