 How Your Laptop Becomes a Server Using Port Forwarding

To allow devices on the internet to access a server running on your laptop, these conditions must be met:

**1. Your router must have a unique Public IP

This Public IP is what the outside world sees.

If you're behind CG-NAT, your ISP must give you a real public IP for port forwarding to work.

2. External device sends a request to that Public IP + Port

Example:

http://123.45.67.89:3000


This request hits your router first.

3. Router must forward that port to your laptop’s local IP

Inside your local network, your laptop has a private IP (like 192.168.1.20).

You configure port forwarding like this:

Public IP (123.45.67.89):3000  →  Local IP (192.168.1.20):3000


Now the router forwards incoming traffic on port 3000 to your laptop.

4. Your laptop must be running a server on that port

Example:
A Node.js server, Django server, or any localhost service listening on:

localhost:3000

5. Result

External users can now access your laptop’s server:

External Device → Public IP → Router → Forwarded Port → Laptop Server
we can host multiple server on the website
