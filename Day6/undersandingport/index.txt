port in  the network allows to run multiple service on the single ip
Analogy 
think of apartment as an ip address
than the ports are flats of the apartment 
this is not the very good analogy but it works 

if port doesnot exist than we can run only one services over an ip 
on a single ip we can have the various ports ranging from 
     0 – 65535 (Total: 65,536 ports)
         Categories:
    Range	        Type	                Example Use
    0 – 1023	    Well-known ports	    HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21), SSH (22)
    1024 – 49151	Registered ports	    Used by user-defined or registered applications
    49152 – 65535	Dynamic/Private ports	Temporary connections (client-side)

    Examples of Common Port Numbers
        Service	    Port
        HTTP	    80
        HTTPS	    443
        FTP	        21
        SSH	        22
        DNS	        53
        SMTP    	25

companies mainly use firewalls to secure the ports 
for eg in an ecommerce company has a publicip 
so port can range from   0 – 65535 (Total: 65,536 ports)
here the company uses port 4000 for email handling 
port 5000 for payment 
this is even bad example  haha
and other ports are uses less so comapny uses firewall to block the other ports  and just give access to handle request of two ports
***chat gpt please refactor this example ***
